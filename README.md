# A List of Anagrams

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/upperlinecode/list-methods-mini-lab-python)](https://repl.it/github/upperlinecode/list-methods-mini-lab-python)

### Introduction

Lists are crazy useful. Whether you're planning a party and creating a guest list, going grocery shopping and creating a grocery list, or debating with your friends about the top 10 movies of all time, you likely already do a lot of your thinking in list form.

As a programmer, lists become powerful tools. For example, if you make a guest list on paper and you want to know how many guests you have, you'd need to go back and number all the guests - for a big party like a wedding, that could take a long time. As a programmer, you can use built in list methods to do things like that for you, and to do it in a lot less time.

Here are a few examples of built-in functions Python can complete almost instantly:
* Alphabetize a list.
* Count the items in a list.
* Access (read or write) a specific item in the list.
* Find a certain item and delete it from the list.
* Insert a new item into a list.

### The goal

We're going to start by making a list of anagrams of the word "stop". If you can rearrange those four letters to make another word, you've found an anagram! We've already got a partial list of anagrams going, but there are a few errors and a few gaps. Let's go back in and make it better.

The challenges are written out in order in a file called lists.py. Code out your solutions after each challenge in that file, and then run the code to see if it worked.  

To test your code, run the command `python lists.py` in the console.

### The trap

A lot of times, it can be tempting to hard-code the answer to simple tasks. AVOID THAT STRATEGY.

Consider this list of numbers:

```Python

cool_numbers = [3, 5, 2, 1, 4]

```

If the instructions asked you to put these numbers in order, you might be tempted to simply go back up and simply rewrite the list:

```Python

# DO NOT CODE THIS WAY. IT IS SUPREMELY INEFFICIENT.
cool_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```

If this is the only way you know how to organize, imagine how exhausting your life becomes if you're trying to organize this dataset:

```Python

cool_numbers = [
  99, 18, 89, 8, 48, 61, 30, 66, 14, 68, 76, 38, 37, 59, 38, 12, 87, 25, 67, 53, 17, 23, 89,
  45, 43, 99, 96, 21, 35, 79, 88, 63, 91, 15, 58, 5, 73, 58, 13, 41, 77, 84, 31, 22, 57,
  24, 72, 2, 90, 77, 39, 67, 55, 0, 73, 61, 65, 70, 17, 83, 99, 79, 56, 32, 66, 12, 9,
  92, 20, 76, 52, 67, 11, 89, 53, 6, 58, 2, 10, 30, 21, 23, 62, 84, 24, 27, 48, 49, 90,
  18, 76, 78, 20, 88, 80, 21, 59, 52, 83, 12, 40, 77, 53, 78, 88, 49, 93, 39, 21, 42,
  71, 59, 53, 14, 21, 9, 68, 46, 81, 48, 53, 98, 51, 77, 65, 64, 93, 11, 73, 91, 31, 62,
  98, 73, 85, 43, 61, 82, 81, 1, 43, 73, 25, 62, 14, 71, 37, 61, 14, 35, 6, 12, 43, 73,
  4, 39, 76, 79, 13, 78, 7, 19, 61, 58, 30, 10, 84, 84, 3, 51, 33, 10, 15, 3, 44, 45,
  28, 61, 58, 10, 13, 40, 85, 49, 13, 60, 16, 62, 5, 93, 7, 87, 42, 69, 27, 22, 40,
  5, 19, 30
]

```

Instead, you want to use built-in methods to do your work for you, and then resave that data in the same variable.

```Python

cool_numbers = [3, 5, 2, 1, 4]
cool_numbers.sort() # Sorts numbers in-place
print(cool_numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```

As you go through this lab, you'll want to refer back to the [python documentation on lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp). This is where you can learn about other methods like ".sort()" that we used above.
